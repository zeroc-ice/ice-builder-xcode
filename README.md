# Ice Builder for Xcode

Ice Builder for Xcode is a command line program to help compile Slice files to C++ or Objective-C in Xcode. It supports
all recent versions of Xcode, including Xcode 8 and Xcode 7.

___Note:___ If you are using Xcode 7, you may want to use instead the [Ice Builder for Xcode plug-in][1].

## Install

### Homebrew

Install Ice Builder for Xcode using Homebrew by running the following commands:

    brew tap zeroc-ice/tap
    brew install ice-builder-xcode

### Manually

Download the [icebuilder](icebuilder) shell script to any path on your system. For example: `/usr/local/bin/icebuilder`.

## Usage

### Options

| Option        | Description                                     |
| :-----------: | ----------------------------------------------- |
| --cpp         | Use `slice2cpp` instead of `slice2objc`.       |
| -h, --help    | Print usage message.                            |
| -v, --version | Display Ice Builder for Xcode version.          |
| -- ARGS       | Arguments passed directly to the slice compiler.|

Refer to the [slice2cpp][2] and [slice2objc][3] _Command Line Options_ documention for a description of the options you can
provide through the args property.

### Xcode Build Rule

To use Ice Builder for Xcode you must create a custom build rule in your Xcode project. The following settings are a
good starting point; however, you may need to modify them depending on your project's needs.

* __Process__: `*.ice`
* __Using__: _Custom script_

    ```
    /usr/local/bin/icebuilder [options]
    ```
* __Output Files__:
    * `$(DERIVED_FILE_DIR)/$(INPUT_FILE_BASE).h`
    * `$(DERIVED_FILE_DIR)/$(INPUT_FILE_BASE).cpp` (For a C++ project)
    * `$(DERIVED_FILE_DIR)/$(INPUT_FILE_BASE).m` (For an Objective-C project)

### Xcode Build Settings

For Cocoa and iPhone applications, which use the IceTouch or Ice Xcode SDKs, you
must add the appropriate directory to the `Additional SDKs` setting:

| Distribution  | Language          | Location                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ice Touch 1.3 | Objective-C       | `/Library/Developer/IceTouch-1.3/SDKs/ObjC/$(PLATFORM_NAME).sdk`   |
| Ice Touch 1.3 | C++               | `/Library/Developer/IceTouch-1.3/SDKs/Cpp/$(PLATFORM_NAME).sdk`    |
| Ice Touch 3.6 | Objective-C       | `/usr/local/lib/IceTouch/ObjC/$(PLATFORM_NAME).sdk`                |
| Ice Touch 3.6 | C++               | `/usr/local/lib/IceTouch/Cpp/$(PLATFORM_NAME).sdk`                 |
| Ice 3.7 beta  | Objective-C       | `/usr/local/lib/IceSDK/$(PLATFORM_NAME).sdk`                       |
| Ice 3.7 beta  | C++               | `/usr/local/lib/IceSDK/$(PLATFORM_NAME).sdk`                       |

You also need to add the following linker options to the `Other Linker Flags` setting:

| Distribution  | Language    | Required                                     | Ice Plugins                                                                                                | Optional Services                                                            |
| ------------  | ----------- | -----------------------------------          | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Ice Touch 1.3 | C++         | `-lIceCpp-libc++`                            | included in the<br>IceCpp-libc++ library                                                                      | `-lGlacier2Cpp-libc++`<br>`-lIceGridCpp-libc++`<br>`-lIceStormCpp-libc++`    |

With Ice 3.7 (iOS and macOS) or Ice Touch (macOS only), you also need to add `-lbz2` and `-liconv`.

You must also link with the following Frameworks:
* `Security.framework` (Ice Touch all the time, Ice when linking with IceSSL)
* `CFNetwork.framework` (iOS)
* `UIKit.framework` (iOS)
* `ExternalAccessory.framework` (iOS when linking with IceIAP)

### Generating Code using Xcode

The builder will always compile a Slice file when executed by an Xcode custom build rule; however, Xcode custom build
rules are only executed when either the given `Output Files` do not exist or are older than the file being processed.
To force your Slice files to be re-compiled you need to clean (⇧⌘K) your project, then build (⌘B).

The builder automatically includes the Ice Slice files directory included with the Ice or Ice Touch SDK as well as the
directory of the Slice file being compiled.

The output directory passed to the slice compiler is determined by comparing the paths of the given `Output files`.
Exactly two files must be set and both files must share the same base directory path.
